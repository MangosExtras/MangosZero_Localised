Text0_0_loc9='Salutations.  My function is to offer access to and, when permissible, insight into information regarding the Creators\' synthesis of the Earthen on the world designated as Azeroth.  I am ready to share this information with you now at your leisure.'
Text0_0_loc9='The Earthen are a synthesized race engineered by the Creators, functioning as one of the seed races in the initial population of the world designated as Azeroth.  The Earthen were created to aid the Creators\' efforts in shaping the deep regions of this world.$B$BThey are a modification of the standard subterranean being matrix used on other worlds that the Creators have seeded.  The construction of this prototype race created various anomalies that were observed after initial synthesis.'
Text0_0_loc9='It is one of the synthesis matrices the Creators use when seeding a world.  Each synthesis matrix is used to achieve the Creators\' goals.  For Azeroth, a subterranean being matrix was modified to create a being with increased durability with an affinity for deep region shaping; the Earthen are the product of this modification.$B$BAfter the Earthen had been put into service for the Creators, unforeseen anomalies were discovered that affected their synthesis matrix due to high-stress environments.'
Text0_0_loc9='Additional background information on the Earthen must be given to you before this question may be answered properly.$B$BProcessing.$B$BTo understand the anomalies of the Earthen, it is first important to understand what the Earthen represent in their design intent.  The Earthen represent the Creators\' attempt at improving the survivability paradigm of the standard subterranean being matrix.  This was done by incorporating a resilient foundation of construction inherent to the world into said matrix.'
Text0_0_loc9='It is the baseline material used in race synthesis.  A cross-section of Azeroth\'s crust was used as the foundation for the Earthen\'s synthesis rather than the typical biomass construction foundation used by the Creators.$B$BResearch on the world\'s composition led the Creators to theorize that an enhanced being could be synthesized that would epitomize the resiliency of this world\'s essence.  This was accomplished by choosing to use a blend of Azeroth\'s various stone core compounds as the foundation.'
Text0_0_loc9='Simply stated, this is correct.$B$BThe Earthen\'s physical features are that of a smaller stature humanoid, though their composition is that of Azeroth\'s various stone core compounds.  Their design maximizes strength and stamina without sacrificing cognitive processing power.  Their skin and musculature are nearly impervious to physical damage, and with very minor modifications the Earthen display a remarkable resiliency to unwanted magical forces.'
Text0_0_loc9='It is integral to the assimilation of this data that it is understood that the Creators wanted to synthesize a race that would long be an integral part of this world\'s development cycle after they had departed.  This race would be instrumental in fulfilling the Creators\' long-term development objectives for Azeroth.  $B$BAs an ancillary note, the nomenclature "Earthen" was deemed apropos for the new race by the Creators, based on the Earthen\'s composition.'
Text0_0_loc9='The Earthen\'s only anomaly in synthesis is the tendency for matrix destabilization while being utilized in high-stress environments.$B$BAddendum: deep earth sculpting was naturally suited to the new matrix design and thus never met the qualifications of duplicating a high-stress environment.$B$BDestabilization was not discovered until well into the Earthen\'s primary service cycle for the Creators.  The Creators began work on post-synthesis modification, rather than recall and re-synthesis.'
Text0_0_loc9='[There is a noticeable pause after you ask this question.]$B$BThe information you request is not currently available in this repository\'s data cycling.  I sincerely apologize for this omission.$B$BPlease request this information after a data cycling update has been performed on this information repository.  You may also request this information from another information repository located on Azeroth.'
Text0_0_loc9='There are two potential results when the Earthen\'s synthesis matrix destabilizes.  Initiating visual aid representation number one.$B$BThe first variant matrix is a degenerative product of synthesis, hereby designated with the common nomenclature of "Trogg".  This variant maintains strength and stamina comparable to the Earthen, but its cognitive processing power has been almost completely compromised.  Force of will and a strong sense of cunning are the only driving factors in the psyche of the trogg.'
Text0_0_loc9='I am unable to process your chronological reference in comparison to the recording of this data, my apologies.$B$BThe trogg retains some composition of Azeroth\'s various stone core compounds, but the loss of cognitive power makes this variant unacceptable to the Creators.$B$BThe trogg procreates as per a standard biomass.  By default it consumes stone and anything else it can acquire, including other troggs.  Cannibalism is considered unacceptable by the Creators.'
Text0_0_loc9='Initiating visual aid representation number two.$B$BThe second resultant variance of the Earthen matrix retains many desired elements when compared to the standard subterranean matrix.  The common nomenclature for this variant is "Dwarf".$B$BThis variant retains strength and stamina inherent to the Earthen.  In some cases, the dwarf even exceeds the cognitive powers of the Earthen\'s matrix.  The dwarf, however, retains none of the physical composition of Azeroth\'s various stone core compounds.'
Text0_0_loc9='The data stored in this repository does indeed correlate with your astute proclamation.$B$BThe dwarf maintains an affinity for the stone composition of Azeroth, but due to the high-stress environmental anomaly within the Earthen\'s synthesis matrix, the dwarf reverts to a default biomass composition as seen in the standard subterranean matrix.$B$BErgo, the dwarf variant does synthesize from the degeneration of the Earthen creation matrix, as you inferred with your query.'
Text0_0_loc9='I am unable to process your chronological reference in comparison to the recording of this data, my apologies.$B$BThough the dwarf maintains most of the Earthen\'s mental attunement to Azeroth\'s stone composition, the reversion back into living biomass remains the main degeneration of the matrix.  Dwarves eat and procreate through means typical to other standard biomasses.$B$BThe Creators view the dwarf as an acceptable variant, worthy of genesis in its own right.'
Text0_0_loc9='The Creators are... the Creators.$B$BThey are the beings that seeded and shaped this world by their own design.  They are the reason for this world\'s existence, as well as many other worlds.  They are the wellspring from which Azeroth flows.'

Text0_0_loc9='Yes, young one, you need not convince me of such things, the Warchief and I have much history. Your dedication, however, is noted.$B$BAs I was saying, Rend had found a new home for his people, and I was among those who would wearily follow.$B$BFrom one conflict arose others... countless others. It was in those battles for Blackrock Spire between the Blackrock clan and the Dark Iron dwarves that my sons were both slain.

Text0_0_loc9='My story? It is kind of you to ask. Very well.$B$BLong ago on the planet Draenor - the remains of which are now known as the Outland - all of the draenei lived in peace. But then the Burning Legion came, and they corrupted the orcs with their fel magics.$B$BWith no other option we fought to survive, but exposure to these fel energies had horrible effects upon some of us, over time transforming us into the Broken like me, or worse, the seemingly mindless Lost Ones.$B$BShall I go on?'
Text0_0_loc9='The fel energies also had the side-effect on the Broken and the Lost Ones of cutting us off from the Light. At the time I did not know exactly why, but as a vindicator I insisted on finding out. I decided to make a pilgrimage to do just that.$B$BAnd so it was that after the war came to its fateful end, I journeyed into the desert of the fragmented planet, beseeching the Light to return to us. But decades passed, and the Light never answered my prayers.$B$BIs this something that you wish to hear more of?'
Text0_0_loc9='I had been fortunate to find an oasis and made the decision to stay there until I received an answer. So there I sat, moving only when absolutely necessary, living off of the creatures that would come near the pool. Such was my pride.$B$BAs I said, decades passed without an answer. But I can remember a particularly beautiful sunset one evening. A warm zephyr blew across the land and I was sure that I heard a voice, but no one was around.$B$BAs you can imagine, I thought that I was finally losing my mind.'
Text0_0_loc9='There was something strange about that wind; it didn\'t stop. For weeks it blew across the land, waxing and waning, but never ceasing. And all the time the voice continued, though I could not understand it, nor did I know where it was coming from.$B$BMy time in solitude had taught me how to calm myself and look inward. This I did in order to keep my sanity. And that is when I began to understand the voice. It was coming from the wind itself and it had much to say!'
Text0_0_loc9='It spoke to me of secrets and power, and also of truths. The Light had not forsaken the Broken! The fel energies that the orcs had wielded long ago against the draenei had infused us, causing a break in our ability to be heard by, or perhaps to hear, the Light. The same that had been responsible for the degradation of our bodies.$B$BBut our spirits were not broken, and the air offered to me another path, through which I might deliver my people.
'
Text0_0_loc9='It taught me the path of shamanism, which in a way is just another facet of the Light. Joining the wind was the water of the oasis, the fire from my camp and the earth upon which I sat. All had something to say.$B$BOver the next few years they taught me what it was to call upon and be one with the elements of the world. And they told me that the worlds of all of the stars in the sky, even this one, are made up of these elements.$B$BBut the day came when I felt that I had learned enough to leave.'
Text0_0_loc9='I returned to my people and was greeted with smiling faces and outstretched arms, mostly from the Broken. The prejudices against us from many draenei had continued in my absence. But it was as if they knew that I was coming, and I soon found out why.$B$BVelen, the prophet and leader of all of the draenei, had seen my return in one of his visions and was there to greet me as well. He asked to speak with me in private and as I related my story to him, he nodded and smiled, for this too he had foreseen.'
Text0_0_loc9='Velen urged me to take a leadership role amongst the Broken. But more importantly, he asked me to teach shamanism to all; Broken and draenei alike. I accepted.$B$BWe knew then that given the prejudices of some that this would be a difficult proposition at best. There are those that despise the Broken because we are a frightening reminder of the past. And there are others who believe the way of the shaman to be a blasphemy against the Light.$B$BIn any case, that is my tale.'
